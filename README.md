# ai-sudoku-solver
AI-driven solver for sudoku puzzles based on the first project of the Udacity advanced-level Artificial Intelligence nano-degree. This project explores the following foundational AI techniques

- **Constraint Propogation:**

    Used throughout AI to dramatically reduce the search space by iteratively applying contraints. As the constraints are propogated, the number of possibilities is reduced on the soduku puzzle.

- **Depth-First Search:**

    Used throughout AI to efficiently find solutions for a wide range of problems (ex: game-playing, route planning). For more information, see an example of Search being used in Google's AlphaGo [paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/alphago/AlphaGoNaturePaper.pdf).
